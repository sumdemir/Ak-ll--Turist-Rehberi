# Smart-tourist-guide
Automated tourism guide, which uses data from the [SPOI dataset](https://sdi4apps.eu/spoi).

Running demo version is available at https://sumdemir.github.io/Akilli-Turist-Rehberi/.

Original version was created at the Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of West Bohemia, as a semestral project at the Department of Geomatics.

!! I added some interactive buttons for that project - @sumdemir !!
